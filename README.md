# sudoku

Three sudoku solvers. They do nothing clever, but they get the job done. If there are too many solutions I recommend learning to use "ctrl-C."

syntax: "python sudoku.py" or "go run sudoku.go" or "g++ sudoku.cpp && ./a.out"

On my machine the go solver is 34 times faster than the python solver, and about as legible.

Probably a failure in my ability to write c++ but go is 4.26 times faster on my machine.
